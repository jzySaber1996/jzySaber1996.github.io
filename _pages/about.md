My name is Ziyou Jiang, the **_Postdoctoral Researcher_** in **_Software Engineering_**. 
I am working in State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Game in **_Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences_** (**_ISCAS_**).
- From 2015~2019, I was studying Xiamen University (XMU), and got my bachelor degree in Software Engineering (School of Software).
- From 2019~2025, I was studying in ISCAS, advised by Prof. Qing Wang (Senior Researcher).
- From 2025~Now, I am working as the PostDoc in ISCAS as well, advised by Prof. Qing Wang.

My major research directions are crowd-based knowledge extraction and analysis, software security oriented threat analysis and vulnerability detection/fixing.
Nowadays, I'm also working on the LLM security, especially the threat analysis and vulnerability identification in LLM tool-learning systems, 
as well as the security in AIGC-generated multimodal elements.

My motto is: 
Always be enthusiastic and powerful to the new research. 
Always write down the useful and necessary papers for the society.
