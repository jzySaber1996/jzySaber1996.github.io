## Personal Information

My name is Ziyou Jiang, the **_Postdoctoral Researcher_** in **_Software Engineering_**. 
I am working in State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Game in **_Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences_** (**_ISCAS_**).
- From 2015~2019, I was studying Xiamen University (XMU), and got my bachelor degree in Software Engineering (School of Software).
- From 2019~2025, I was studying in ISCAS, advised by Prof. Qing Wang (Senior Researcher).
- From 2025~Now, I am working as the PostDoc in ISCAS as well, advised by Prof. Qing Wang.

My major research directions are crowd-based knowledge extraction and analysis, software security oriented threat analysis and vulnerability detection/fixing.
Nowadays, I'm also working on the LLM security, especially the threat analysis and vulnerability identification in LLM tool-learning systems, 
as well as the security in AIGC-generated multimodal elements.

## Research publications

- **Dialogue Disentanglement:** My publications about dialogue disentanglement have been accepted at top conferences in artificial intelligence, i.e., IJCAI'21 and IJCAI'22. 

- **Knowledge Extraction:** The publications of crowd-based issue-solution and bug-report extraction have been accepted at top conferences ESEC/FSE'21, ASE'21, ICSE'22, and also awarded the ASE'21 distinguished paper award. 

- **Threat&Vulnerability:** Our research on crowd-based secure coding practice enricher and patch example generation has been accepted at ASE'23 & ASE’24.

- **LLM Security:** Our research on the information-theft attack in LLM tool-learning system is accepted by ACL'25.

## Social Activities

I am also the psychological committee member in the laboratory, and enjoy playing piano and football and go hiking.
In fact, when I was in the preliminary school, my major is piano lol :) (amateur level, not professional).

I prefer sharing with my new thoughts with you in the leisure time, and do not be too strict.
To be honest, I think the researchers need to be happy and enthusiastic, not always work by yourself.

## My Motto

- _Always be enthusiastic and powerful to the new research._ 
- _Always write down the useful and necessary papers for the society._

Latest News
======
- Our research on the information-theft attack in LLM tool-learning system is accepted by **_ACL'25 Main Conference_**!! (AutoCMD).
- I'm working on the National Key Research and Development Projects, i.e., Security Risks in AIGC-Generated Multimodal Contents.
- I'm working on the automated threat modeling for LLM tool-learning systems and MCP, cuz it is too difficult via the human designing.
